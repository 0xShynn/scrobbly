## About the project

As a music lover I always wanted to create a project related to music, the idea to create a scrobbler app came when I wanted to share my 'top tracks' of the month to a friend, I had a few tracks in my mind but I couldn't gave some sort of list quickly. As we live in a digital era of abundance of releases of all kinds, it's hard to keep track of everything nowadays. That's when I thought about Last.fm services.

Scrobbly fetch your music's data using Last.fm API and display your recent scrobbles, top artists,albums and tracks on your mobile phone, that way, your favorite music's data is always at hand.
