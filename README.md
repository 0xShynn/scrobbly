## Description

Scrobbly is a React Native mobile app for iOS/Android, it retrieves your Last.fm data to display your recent scrobbles, top tracks/albums/artists in a clean and elegant way.

## About the project

As a music lover I always wanted to create a project related to music, the idea of creating a scrobbler app came the moment I wanted to share my 'top tracks of the month' to a friend. I had a few tracks in my mind but I was unable to share a quick list. As we live in a era of abundance of digital releases, it's hard to keep track of everything nowadays. That's when I thought about Last.fm services.

Scrobbly fetch your music's data using Last.fm API and display your recent scrobbles, your top artists, albums and tracks (on many periods) on your mobile phone. That way, your favorite music's data is always at hand.
